# Solid Panels

Below is a listing of [Solid Panels](README.md#solid-panels). Solid Panels are groups of individuals focused on a specific problem or domain relevant to Solid, with an aim to propose changes to the Solid Specification, Solid Roadmap, and/or Supporting Documentation. Anyone may join a panel or suggest a new panel.

Anyone can create a Solid Panel by submitting a request to the Solid W3C community group mailing list, or by making a pull request directly to this document.

This listing helps people find panels in which they may want to participate, and helps editors find panels to consult as part of the editorial process.

## Example Panel
This is an example that people can use as a template for submitting their own panels. A description of the panel, including its focus and goal, should go here.

## Cryptography, Security, and Privacy
Discussion and specs related to performing decentralized Key Management, Cryptographic Signatures (including integration with [Verifiable Credentials](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/)), and at-rest data Encryption on Solid servers. Pertaining to mechanisms used and considerations taken when securing a data pod, a conformant server implementation, and/or the immediate ecosystem around them.  Pertaining to the mechanisms through which cryptographic techniques are employed to provide data privacy, data integrity, and verifiable information. The focus of this panel is to ensure Privacy is always kept in mind in the various proposals of the project across all panels, and that individuals' rights are inherently protected in the Solid ecosystem. It will do so by:
- Leading Privacy discussions and initiatives.
- Reviewing the proposals of other panels for anything Privacy related, and provide guidance to them if requested.
- Researching how the technical side of the project (specification, implementations):
  - Can affect the Privacy of individuals; Per example by unexpectedly leaking information in the protocol itself.
  - Affect their rights; Per example by making it difficult for them to find privacy policies or delete remote content.
  - Lead to any kind of harm to the individual; Per example, by allowing a malicious individual to publish private content unchecked.
- Ensuring practical guides are produced for individuals and Data Privacy Officers alike, allowing them to know how to deal with their legal rights and obligations respectively.
- Making sure laws like GDPR are directly taken into account when designing new feature / product / software.

## Data Interoperability and Portability
Ensuring the interoperability of data as it is read and written by different users and/or applications. Topics of discussion will include vocabularies, shapes, footprints, and the mechanisms through which these work together to provide consistent and safe access and manipulation of data in a pod by different agents and/or users. Pertaining to mechanisms that ensure disparate applications or agents can safely and seamlessly read and write the data they need.  Pertaining to mechanisms that ensure the portability of data stored in a data pod such that it can be safely migrated between conformant Solid server implementations, as well as exported to other mediums.
