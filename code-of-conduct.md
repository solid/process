# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members of the Solid community pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

In addition to this Code of Conduct, we adhere to the [Positive Work Environment
at W3C: Code of Ethics and Professional
Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

## Standards of Behaviour

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and acknowledging harm caused to those affected by
  our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

* Asking for confirmation instead of assuming
* Taking constructive actions, and move towards consensus when possible

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting, derogatory or demeaning comments, and personal or
  political attacks
* Communicating in a tone and language that could lead to creating a hostile and
  unwelcoming environment
* Public or private harassment or threats. Harassment includes: offensive
  comments related to age, body size, visible or invisible disability,
  ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender, gender identity and expression, level
  of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
  appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
  of an individual or group, unwelcome comments relating to any aspect of a
  person's lifestyle choices and personal life, deliberate misgendering and use
  of "dead" or rejected names, stalking and intimidation
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address or
  any aspect of a person's identity, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Instances of Code of Conduct violations will be handled by the Code of Conduct
Committee.

The Code of Conduct Committee are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

The Code of Conduct Committee have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not
limited to the Gitter chat rooms, Solid forum, and GitHub repositories, and also
applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public
spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
