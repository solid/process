# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team 
## Purpose
This charter sets out to explain the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team (DEIT). It provides a concise overview of our mission which is increasing voices in the Solid community by inviting individuals from all underrepresented groups. The team shall review interactions, make sure there are equal and supportive opportunities for those in underrepresented groups, and make recommendations to the Solid Team and Community.
## Membership
The Team shall consist of both chair members and community members. All chair members and community members join on a volunteer basis. The chair members are appointed by the Director of Solid and serve an indefinite term. Elections are during the first quarter of the year. The prospective chair candidate can self-nominate, or be nominated by a member’s suggestion. The current chairs are:
* Lead Chair: [Marrelle Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marrelle-bailey/) – Works for [Inrupt]([Inrupt](https://inrupt.com/)
* Chair: [Sarven Capadisli](https://csarven.ca/#i) ([Inrupt](https://inrupt.com/))
* Chair: Jeff Zucker 
* Chair: Kyra Assaad
* Chair: Virginia Balseiro 
The Director of Solid and chair members will determine the number of community members, always greater than two, and meet or exceed regulatory requirements. All those in an chair members role must disclose relevant ties to organizations/directorships. Make sure to inform the DEIT of any changes like directorships when the changes take place. Ties that should be disclosed are working with organizations or companies affiliated with Solid like Janeiro Digital, Inrupt, etc. At this time, there are no issues with having multiple affiliations in the Solid community. Anyone can join. The administrators shall establish and approve formal and transparent remuneration policies and procedures for all team members. Chair members do not get paid for any directors’ fees. No fees will be required to join. 
## Authority
The DEIT has no expressed or implied power or authority above any other Teams in Solid. The DEIT will hold other Soid Teams accountable in all significant decisions and changes the DEIT makes for the community. The work that we are invested in is written below.
* Increasing diversity, inclusion, and equity throughout the Solid community/ecosystem
    Making recommendations to the Solid Team and Director of Solid to increase opportunities for all underrepresented groups to make changes
* Advocating for the community 
    If either the Solid Team members or community member do not comply with the DEIT’s recommendations or policies. In that case, it will be up to the Solid Team to remedy and/or resolve. They will take action on a case-by-case basis by consulting with the DEIT. 
* Measuring the success behind our recommendations
    Surveys are offered to various community groups to assess education level, expertise, accessibility/disability, gender, and underrepresented groups. 
    Focus groups will be gathered to report on progress; better see how we can support outside groups or individuals to join or thrive in Solid. 
## Responsibilities
The DEI Team Chairs will report their activities to the Director of Solid, in summary, published quarterly.
Creating a plan for diversity and inclusion with best practices in the Solid project. Also working alongside the W3C’s Inclusion and Diversity Community Group and the Positive Work Environment Community Group.
Increase outreach of Solid’s work into communities with underrepresented groups. 
Achieve gender equity building a voice, volunteer/job opportunities, and work in the Solid community
## Meetings
The DEIT will meet at least quarterly and more often as needed. A majority of the community members shall constitute a quorum. The lead chair will keep a copy of the team meeting minutes and forward a copy to the board secretary. The chair members may invite any director, officer, staff member, expert, or other advisors who aren’t a committee member to sit in, listen, and advise for support. But these individuals will have no voting power.
The DEIT team will review its charter twice a year and recommend any proposed changes to the board for review. This document will also be available to the public. If you would like to make changes, please submit a PR.
